# Stock-Return-Analysis-with-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
In this notebook, we simulated a very specific investing scenario on past ETFs to determine which one is the best to invest in.

## Scenario
I am a college student who works a part-time job and wants to invest in an ETF (usually a "portfolio" of stocks). Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we can simulate returns over time for these portfolios to see which will statistically give me the most money by the time I graduate.

## Strategy
With a Monte Carlo simulation, you essentially play out different possibilities many times, sometimes up to 1 million times. I this example, we will only run the simulation 1500 times, as there are 1500 dates to compare our 4-year investment on. We will then compare this to the actual average and standard deviations of investments. 

## Results
The Monte Carlo simulation was able to closely mimic the actual returns on every investment date, which shows its efficiency and effectiveness when trying to do these types of simulations.
